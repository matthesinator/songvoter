## Songvoter
### Let your viewers choose which tracks you play
- Upload `.csv` files with tracks in the format `id,title`
- Save playlists for later use
- Name your playlists
- Allow your viewers to choose songs from those playlists
- Keep track which songs have been played
  
### Further ideas
- More elaborate statistics
- Rate limiter
- Block new requests
- HTTPS
- Log in with twitch (needs HTTPS)\
  -> more than one streamer at a time can use the site
- Let viewers vote on tracks in the queue to change their order
- Ability to add single songs to playlist after a playlist is already uploaded
